### Various challenges you may encounter when, trying to get your VSCode env setup

1. git fails to work - `xcrun: error`

probably a mac os upgrade (e.g. Mojave to Catalina ) issue you will see on using git commands:

```bash
git status
xcrun: error: invalid active developer path (/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools), 
missing xcrun at: /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/usr/bin/xcrun
```
dependancies on xcode!

```sh
xcode-select --install
```
You will be prompted to install command line developer tools!

* Weâ€™re still waiting for the gRPC v1.25.0 binaries to be published so you may be affected by [this issue](https://github.com/IBM-Blockchain/blockchain-vscode-extension/issues/1621), where gRPC fails to rebuild when using VS Code 1.40.x.
   > Please see [this comment](https://github.com/IBM-Blockchain/blockchain-vscode-extension/issues/1621#issuecomment-552926559) for a workaround.
