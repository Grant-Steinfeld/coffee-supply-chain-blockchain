# How to Create a Supply Chain Blockchain App

Blockchain increases visibility and efficiency in the supply chain like the coffee trade. See how blockchain can assist farmers, roaster and everyone between, bring you a fresher and fairer cup. Come out and we will walk you through design, development, and deployment of an illustrative blockchain network and application.

In this hands on workshop, you will learn about...

- Developing a supply chain blockchain application with VS Code
- Deploying it on the IBM Blockchain Platform.
- Successful Blockchain applications in the Supply Chain space such as IBM Food Trust and others
- Best practices for developing blockchain applications today and looking forward to the future


## Components used
* IBM Blockchain Platform Extenstion for Visual Studio Code
* Hyperledger Fabric

## Prequisites

Please [sign up for an IBM cloud account](https://ibm.biz/BdqRMt)

For IBM Blockchain Platform to work correctly the following software tools and exact versions need to be in setup.

1. [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) 

Visual Studio Code(VSCode) is a popular IDE that runs on all major operating systems.

For this workshop you will need to confirm you have the  ***Sept 2019 version 1.39.x***  of Visual Studio Code installed.

If not that's OK, just 
[download the older version, 1.39.x from Microsoft here](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_39)

> TIP: Pin VSCode Version!! Be sure to change `Setttings/Update:Mode` to `manual`
<details><summary><strong>How to ...</strong></summary>
Pin this version for the duration of this workshop/blockchain discovery untill stable release of ecosystem is availible. ( otherwise each vscode restart will update vscode!)

</details>



## Great!  Now lets make sure you have all the other required software and versions:

1. node.js
1. npm
1. docker
1. docker-compose

check the versions by running these commands at your terminal

```bash
node -v
v10.16.3

npm -v
6.13.7

docker -v
Docker version 19.03.5, build 633a0ea

docker-compose -v
docker-compose version 1.25.4, build 8d51620a

```
If you have these, awesome!  

If you don't have the correct version of node.js and npm? No worries!
<details><summary><strong> We recommend using Node Version Manager(NVM)</strong> to run mutliple node.js version safely on your computer</summary>
  > Follow the [NVM install docs here](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm)
